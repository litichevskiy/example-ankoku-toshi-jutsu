But there was another certainty about the world behind the mountains.','Izuya, son of a simple carpenter, heard it for the first time when he sat behind a rock, observing the older ones working. They mentioned an artifact, lying in a distant cave that could only be found by those, who have the courage, the strength and the willingness to compete a dangerous journey. A journey, leading far beyond the protecting mountains. Over country and sea, over cliffs and stones, through cold and wind. No one ever considered taking the apparently impossible test.']

It was made of Nyōkah, a special  kind of stone, which can only be found in the mountain caves of Nyōkō. “If you leave, take a piece of home with you. As you arrive and take something that belongs to this place, leave your piece instead. It will be connected to your soul and your home forever.
